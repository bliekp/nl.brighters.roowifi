# RooWifi App

This little app enables you to command your Roomba vacuumcleaner using a RooWifi module on top of it.

What works::
* Homey responds to the 'clean' and 'dock' commands. However, for now this only a simple trigger.

What doesn't work (yet):

* Clean & dock command.
* Reporting of battery level,
* Flowcards for battery, cleaning and docking status.
